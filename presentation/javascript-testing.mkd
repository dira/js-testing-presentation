* want to convince you to test your JS, if you don't do that already

# And…

A kitten dies *every time* you hit refresh & click to test

# How does it look like?

    expect(deadKittens).toEqual(0)
    
    expect($('#welcome').length).toEqual(1)


# What do you need?

* separate your JS from the DOM (no inline JS)
* structure the code (classes, modules)
* separate the definition and the running step (dom.ready … )
